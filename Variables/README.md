Variables (or) Identifier 
-------------------------
  

- Variable are used to store values in reserved memory location. 

- No explicit declaration of data types is needed for variable 

	(i.e) int x; -> This is not required 

	Hence python is Dynamically typed programming 

		x=10 -> it automatically take x as integer 

		Y=4.5 -> float 

		Z=5+4j -> complex 


Naming Rules: 
-------------

- Variable length can be of anything. 

- Identifier names should start with an alphabet or underscore(_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits 

- No other special characters are allowed. 

- Identifier names are case sensitive. 

- Reserved words should not be used as a variable 

- Spaces should not be there
