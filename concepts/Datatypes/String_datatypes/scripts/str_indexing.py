Indexing:

- In Python, indexing refers to the **process of accessing a specific element in a sequence, such as a string or list, using its position or index number**. 
- Indexing in Python starts at **0**, which means that the **first element in a sequence has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on**.
