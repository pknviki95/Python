## Arithmetic operators:

- **Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmmetic operations such as addition,Subtraction,Multiplication,Division,Modulo,Floor division,Exponential**

'''
x=10
y=5.2

### Addition:
# Addition operator (+) is used for performing addition of values

addition=x+y
print("Addition of x and y: ",addition)

### Subtraction:
# Subtraction operator (-) is used for performing Subtraction of values

Subtraction=x-y
print("Subtraction of x and y: ",Subtraction)

### Multiplication:
# Multiplication operator (*) is used for performing Multiplication of values

Multiplication=x*y
print("Multiplication of x and y: ",Multiplication)

### Modulo:
# Modulo operator (%) is used for performing Modulo operation of values to return its reminder value

Modulo=x%y
print("Modulo of x and y: ",Modulo)

### Division:
# Division operator (/) is used for performing Division of values
# Division always return Float type

Division=x/y
print("Division of x and y: ",Division)

### Floor Division:
# Floor Division operator (//) is used for performing Floor Division of values
# (i.e) Division always return Float type; Floor Division return integer value/decimal values based on input

Floordivision=x//y
print("Floordivision of x and y: ",Floordivision)

### Exponential or power:
# Exponential return power value of the value passed (i.e) i^2

Exponential=x**2
print("Exponential of x: ",Exponential)
