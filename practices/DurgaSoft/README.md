#### Explanation:

- ```sys.argv``` holds list elements ```['P05_sys_argv_command_line_argument_sum.py', '1', '2', '3', '24']```
- ```sys.argv[1:]``` Index value to start from first argument.
- ```sum_value+=int(index_value)``` :
    - ```+=``` - Addition and assign argument to sum value.
    - ```int(index_value)``` - typecast to int as list elements is string values.

#### Program-06: [P06_if_else_statement_big_small_num.py](https://github.com/pknviki95/Python/tree/main/practices/DurgaSoft/P06_if_else_statement_big_small_num.py) - Write a  program to find smallest and biggest number using if else statements:

else:
    print("Numbers are equal")
```
#### input:

```
#### input:
```python
Enter the number-1: 10
Enter the number-2: 10
```
#### output:
```python
Numbers are equal
```
#### Explanation:
- ```if number_1>number_2:``` - if condition satisfied it executes if statements.
- ```elif number_2>number_1:``` - if condition is not satisfied it executes elif statements.
- ```else:``` - if and elif condition is not satisfied it executes else statements.

#### Program-07: [P07_if_else_statement_range1to100.py](https://github.com/pknviki95/Python/tree/main/practices/DurgaSoft/P07_if_else_statement_range1to100.py) - Write a  program to find given number is between the range of 1 to 100:

```python

if input_number in range(1,101):
    print(f"The number {input_number} is between 1 to 100")
else:
    print(f"The number {input_number} is outside the range of 1 to 100")
```

#### input:
```python
Enter the number: 50
```
#### output:
```python
The number 50 is between 1 to 100
```

#### input:
```python
Enter the number: 101 
```
#### output:
```python
The number 101 is outside the range of 1 to 100
```
#### Explanation:
- ```if input_number in range(1,101):``` if this condition satisfies it executes the if condition statements.
- ```in``` Membership operator checks if the numbers is present in ```range(start,end+1) function```
- It checks if the user input number is in between 1 to 100 range.

#### Program-08: [P08_for_loop_range_odd.py](https://github.com/pknviki95/Python/tree/main/practices/DurgaSoft/P08_for_loop_range_odd.py) - Write a  program to find given odd number between the range of 0 to 20:

```python
for value in range(0,21):
    
    # odd values logic
    if (value%2)!=0:
        print(value)
```
#### output:
```python
1
3
5
7
9
11
13
15
17
19
```
#### Explanation:

- ```for``` loop to iterate the elements in range function ```range(0,21)```.
- ```(value%2)!=0``` - modulo operation to get the reminder value ; if the reminder value not equal to 0 it returns ```odd value```.

#### Program-09: [P09_for_loop_10to1_descending.py](https://github.com/pknviki95/Python/tree/main/practices/DurgaSoft/P09_for_loop_10to1_descending.py) - Write a  program to print number in descending order from 10to 1:

```python
# range(start,stop,step)

for number in range(10,0,-1):
    print(number)
```
#### output:
```python
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```
#### Explanation:

- ```for number in range(10, 0, -1)```: This line initiates a for loop that iterates over a sequence generated by the range function.
- ```range(start, stop, step)``` - creates a sequence of numbers starting from start, up to (but not including) stop, with a specified step.
range(10, 0, -1)
- ```10``` is the starting point of the sequence. The loop will start with number set to 10.
- ```0``` is the stopping point, but itâ€™s not included in the sequence. The sequence will end before reaching 0, so the loop will run while number is greater than 0.
- ```-1``` is the step, meaning the sequence decreases by 1 on each iteration.
- ```print(number)```-This line prints the current value of number to the console during each iteration of the loop.

#### Program-10: [P10_for_loop_sum_of_num_list.py](https://github.com/pknviki95/Python/tree/main/practices/DurgaSoft/P10_for_loop_sum_of_num_list.py) - Write a  program to print sum of numbers in list sequence:

```python
list_numbers=eval(input("Enter the list of numbers: "))

# empty global variable initialization

sum_value=0

for numbers in list_numbers:

    # Arithmetic and Assign operator to perform sum
    # sum_value= 0+[list values]
    sum_value+=numbers

print("sum of list values: ",sum_value)
```

#### Input:

```python
Enter the list of numbers: [1,2,5,7]
```
#### output:

```python
sum of list values:  15
```
#### Explanation:

- The ```eval()``` function then evaluates this string as a Python expression. This allows users to enter a list-like input such as [1, 2, 3], which eval() interprets as a ```list of numbers```.
- The variable ```sum_value``` is initialized to ```0```. This variable will accumulate the sum of the numbers in the list.
- The ```for``` loop iterates over each element in list_numbers.
- In each iteration, the current element ```(numbers)``` is added to ```sum_value```. 
- The ```+= operator``` adds the value of numbers to the current value of sum_value and then updates sum_value with this new total.

#### Program-11: [P11_while_loop_num_1_20_divisible_3.py](https://github.com/pknviki95/Python/tree/main/practices/DurgaSoft/P11_while_loop_num_1_20_divisible_3.py) - Write a  program to print numbers from 1 to 20 that is divisible by 3:

```python
initial_value=1

while initial_value<=20:
    if initial_value%3==0:
        print("Current initial value that is divisible by 3: ",initial_value)
    initial_value+=1

print("Exiting while loop as it fails in condition after last execution value : ",initial_value)
```
#### output:
```python
Current initial value that is divisible by 3:  3
Current initial value that is divisible by 3:  6
Current initial value that is divisible by 3:  9
Current initial value that is divisible by 3:  12
Current initial value that is divisible by 3:  15
Current initial value that is divisible by 3:  18
Exiting while loop as it fails in condition after last execution value :  21
```

#### Program-12: [P12_while_loop_sum_natural_numbers.py](https://github.com/pknviki95/Python/tree/main/practices/DurgaSoft/P12_while_loop_sum_natural_numbers.py) - Write a  program to return sum of n natural numbers:


```python
input_numbers=int(input("Enter the number: "))

sum_value=0
incremental_value=1
while incremental_value<=input_numbers:
    sum_value+=incremental_value
    incremental_value+=1
print("Sum of n value: ",sum_value)
```

#### input:
```python
Enter the number: 10
```
#### output:
```python
Sum of n value:  55
```

#### Program-13: [P13_break_statement_greaterthan500.py](https://github.com/pknviki95/Python/tree/main/practices/DurgaSoft/P13_break_statement_greaterthan500.py) - Write a  program to break from loop using break statement if cart value exceeds more than 500:

```python
cart_value={'milk':28,'sugar':10,'vegetables':240,'lotion':550,'toothpaste':40}

for iteration in cart_value.values():
    print("Current iteration value: ",iteration)
    if iteration>500:
        print(f"Executing the break statement inside loop as {iteration} is greater than 500")
        break
print(f"outside the loop as {iteration} value")
```

#### output:

```python
Current iteration value:  28
Current iteration value:  10
Current iteration value:  240
Current iteration value:  550
Executing the break statement inside loop as 550 is greater than 500
outside the loop as 550 value
```

#### Explanation:

- ```dictionary``` cart_value contains items as ```keys``` and their corresponding prices as ```values```.
- The loop iterates over the values in the dictionary ```(cart_value.values())```, assigning each value to the variable iteration.
- During each iteration, the loop checks if the current value (iteration) is greater than ```500```.
- If the condition is ```true``` (i.e., iteration > 500), the ```break``` statement is executed, which immediately exits the loop.
- A message is printed indicating that the loop is being exited because the value is greater than 500.
- After the loop exits (either by completing all iterations or due to the break statement), a final print statement displays the value of iteration that caused the loop to exit.

#### Program-14: [P14_prime_number_or_not.py](https://github.com/pknviki95/Python/tree/main/practices/DurgaSoft/P14_prime_number_or_not.py) - Write a  program to check if the given number is prime or not:

```python

else:
    for iteration in range(2,input_number):
        # prime number logic - number if divided by other number then it is not prime.
        if input_number%iteration==0:
            is_prime=False
            break
if is_prime==True:
    print("The number is prime number")
if is_prime==False:
    print("The number is not prime number")
```
